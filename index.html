        <p>My hobby is coding cool webpages and apps. Coding is very cool and I think everyone should learn it. I take classes at Whitehat Jr and use the apps Thunkable, Code.org, Brackets and CodePen. Brackets and Codepen are text-based coding websites. Code.org and Thunkable are block-based coding websites. In my opinion, I think text-based coding is easier then block-based coding because it's easier to type than drag a block to where it should go. With coding, you can learn new things. I learned about te "Sun and Earth Revolution" and more about Tim Berner-Lee. Codung will open your eyes to wat technolegy can do and what YOU can do.
